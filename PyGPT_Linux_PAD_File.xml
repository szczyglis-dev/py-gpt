<Program_Description_Long><![CDATA[PyGPT is all-in-one Desktop AI Assistant that provides direct interaction with OpenAI language models, including GPT-4, GPT-4 Vision, and GPT-3.5, through the OpenAI API. The application also integrates with alternative LLMs, like those available on HuggingFace, by utilizing Langchain.

Features
- Desktop AI Assistant for Windows and Linux, written in Python.
- Works similarly to ChatGPT, but locally (on a desktop computer).
- 6 modes of operation: Assistant, Chat, Vision, Completion, Image generation, Langchain.
- Supports multiple models: GPT-4, GPT-3.5, and GPT-3, including any model accessible through Langchain.
- Handles and stores the full context of conversations (short-term memory).
- Real-time video camera capture in Vision mode
- Internet access via Google Custom Search API.
- Speech synthesis via Microsoft Azure TTS and OpenAI TTS.
- Speech recognition via OpenAI Whisper.
- Image analysis via GPT-4 Vision.
